REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin design_1_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRBWRADDR[0] (net: design_1_i/bram_0/inst/bram_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/m_ctrl1/mem_i/r_addr[0]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/image_processor_0/inst/w_addr_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
